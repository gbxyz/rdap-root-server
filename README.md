# RDAP Server for the Root Zone and ICANN-accredited registrars

This repository contains:

1. an nginx config file that provides a front-end to the RDAP records for
   top-level domains and ICANN-accredited registrars generated by the scripts in
   the [rdap-data-sources](https://github.com/gbxyx/rdap-data-sources)
   repository;
2. A Dockerfile that creates a Docker image for that nginx config;
3. A fly.toml file to deploy that image onto the fly.io platform.

Since all the complex business logic lives in `rdap-data-sources`, this can be
an exceptionally simple front-end, with no code, only configuration.
